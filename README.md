# Bioinformatics Basics

## Overview
This repository documents my structured transition into bioinformatics,
with a focus on clinically relevant data analysis using R.

It contains foundational scripts, notes and small analyses that build the
skills required for large-scale bioinformatics and computational biology projects.

## Background
I am a clinical biochemist with experience in diagnostic laboratory medicine
and personalised medicine. My interest lies in applying computational methods
to biological and clinical datasets, particularly in translational and
patient-focused research.

## Goals of This Repository
- Develop strong foundations in R for data analysis
- Practice data cleaning, visualisation and statistical methods
- Build habits for reproducible and well-documented research
- Prepare for larger bioinformatics projects involving omics data

## Tools
- R / RStudio
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- Base statistical methods

## Status
This repository is actively being developed as part of a long-term
bioinformatics research portfolio.
